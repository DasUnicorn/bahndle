# BAHNdle
Bahndle *('Bahn'- german for train)* is a german train journey guessing game with real train Data.
Provided with a start locatiion, the time needed to reach the searched destination as well as the number of transfers the journey takes, the user has to find the destination.
The goal is to find the destination in as few guesses as possible. A challenge targetted to the Train-Nerd-Community, that like me, take all her travels through the country only on public transport and have a good knowledge of the train network in general.

This project uses HTML/CSS/Vanilla JavaScript to display a fully responsive web experience. And uses the [Rest API by Jannis](https://v6.db.transport.rest/) for live data.
