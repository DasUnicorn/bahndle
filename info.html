		<h2>How the Game works</h2>
		<div class="left">
			<p>You start at a German Train Station. And have to find your destination. Your Destination is always an ICE (InterCity Express) Station.</p>
			<p>The Game Provides you with the information on how long your journey is and how much transfers you have. Keep in mind that the time presented includes your transit and waiting time.</p>
			<p>You know have to make your first guess by entering a valid ICE train station.</p>
			<p>ðŸŸ© If the entered station is the correct answer. The result turns green and you win!</p>
			<p>ðŸŸ¨ If you enter an incorrect answer but the stop is on the way, it turns yellow with the travel-time left from this spot.</p>
			<p>ðŸŸ¥ If the stop isn't on the journey, the result turns red.</p>
			<p>Your goal is to try to find the correct destination in as minimal guesses as possible.</p>
