		<h2>How the Game works</h2>
		<div class="left">
			<p>Welcome to Bahndle!</p>
			<p>You're embarking on a German train journey adventure, starting at a local station and aiming to pinpoint your destinationâ€” an ICE (InterCity Express) station. The game equips you with crucial journey details: the total duration, (which includs transit and wait times) and the number of transfers required.</p>
			<p> Keep in mind, your route may include both regional and long-distance trains, and it might not be the absolute fastest connection, but still the fastes at a specific moment in time.</p>
			<p>Your first move is to make an educated guess by entering a valid ICE train station.</p>
			<p>ðŸŸ© If the station you entered is the correct answer, the result turns green, signaling your victory in the game!</p>
			<p>ðŸŸ¨ If your entered station is along the route but not the final destination, the result turns yellow. It also provides the remaining travel time to help you refine your guesses. Keep goingâ€”you're getting closer!</p>
			<p>ðŸŸ¥ If the station you entered isn't part of the journey you're seeking, the result turns red.</p>
			<p>Your mission: pinpoint the correct destination in as few guesses as possible. Test your intuition and train knowledge to conquer the challenge!</p>
			<p>Let the journey begin!</p>
